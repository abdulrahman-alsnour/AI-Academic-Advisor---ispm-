DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - AI Academic Advisor
======================================

STEP 1: CREATE NEW GITHUB REPOSITORY
-------------------------------------
1. Go to https://github.com and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: "ai-academic-advisor" (or your preferred name)
5. Description: "AI Academic Advisor System for University of Jordan"
6. Choose: Public or Private (your choice)
7. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have code)
8. Click "Create repository"

STEP 2: PREPARE YOUR LOCAL CODE
--------------------------------
1. Open terminal/command prompt in your project folder
2. Make sure you're in the plan-my-major directory

STEP 3: INITIALIZE GIT (IF NOT ALREADY DONE)
--------------------------------------------
Run these commands:
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Academic Advisor System"

STEP 4: CONNECT TO GITHUB AND PUSH
-----------------------------------
After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub username and repo name)

STEP 5: DEPLOY TO VERCEL (RECOMMENDED - EASIEST)
-------------------------------------------------
Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect it's a Vite project
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Your site will be live in 2-3 minutes!
8. You'll get a URL like: https://your-project.vercel.app

Option B: Netlify
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Build settings:
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Publish directory: dist
6. Click "Deploy site"
7. Your site will be live!

Option C: GitHub Pages
1. In your GitHub repo, go to Settings > Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main
4. Folder: / (root)
5. But first, you need to configure Vite for GitHub Pages:
   - Update vite.config.ts (see below)

STEP 6: CONFIGURE FOR DEPLOYMENT
--------------------------------
If using GitHub Pages, update vite.config.ts:

  export default defineConfig({
    base: '/your-repo-name/',  // Add this line
    // ... rest of config
  })

For Vercel/Netlify: No configuration needed!

STEP 7: TEST YOUR DEPLOYED SITE
---------------------------------
1. Visit your deployment URL
2. Test login functionality
3. Test student and admin features
4. Check all pages load correctly

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If build fails: Check that all dependencies are in package.json
- If routes don't work: Make sure you're using client-side routing (React Router)
- If images don't load: Check image paths are correct
- For GitHub Pages: May need to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter

RECOMMENDED: Use Vercel - it's the easiest and works perfectly with React/Vite!
