INTRODUCTION

The AI Academic Advisor is a comprehensive web-based academic planning system developed specifically for the University of Jordan's Computer Information Systems (CIS) program. This platform addresses the growing need for efficient academic guidance and streamlined communication between students and academic advisors in higher education institutions.

The system was designed to transform how students navigate their academic journey by providing them with intelligent tools for course planning, progress tracking, and personalized academic recommendations. Traditional academic advising often faces challenges such as limited advisor availability, difficulty in tracking student progress across multiple semesters, and the complexity of managing prerequisite requirements for a 132-credit hour program. This system directly addresses these pain points by offering a centralized, user-friendly platform that empowers students to take control of their academic planning while providing advisors with the tools they need to efficiently review and approve study plans.

SYSTEM OBJECTIVES

The primary objectives of the AI Academic Advisor system are multifaceted, focusing on enhancing both the student experience and administrative efficiency:

First, the system aims to improve student academic planning and decision-making. By providing students with a comprehensive dashboard that displays their current academic standing, including completed credits, GPA, graduation progress, and upcoming course recommendations, students can make informed decisions about their course selections. The system tracks progress across different course categories including core courses, electives, and general education requirements, giving students a clear picture of where they stand in their academic journey.

Second, the platform seeks to streamline the advisor-student interaction process. Academic advisors often manage dozens of students simultaneously, making it challenging to review study plans in a timely manner. The Advisor Dashboard consolidates all student requests in one place, allowing advisors to quickly view pending applications, review requested courses, check student notes, and make approval or rejection decisions with appropriate feedback. This centralized approach significantly reduces the administrative burden on advisors while ensuring students receive timely responses to their study plan submissions.

Third, the system provides intelligent course recommendations through an AI-powered chatbot interface. Students can interact with the system to receive personalized advice about course selection, prerequisite checking, and academic planning strategies. This feature is particularly valuable for students who may not have immediate access to their advisors or need quick answers to common academic questions.

Fourth, the platform maintains a complete and searchable course catalog that includes all 132 credit hours required for the CIS degree program. Courses are organized by type (University Requirements, Faculty Requirements, Core Courses, and Electives) and include detailed information such as prerequisites, credit hours, recommended year and semester, and department affiliations. This comprehensive database ensures students have all the information they need to make informed course selections.

Fifth, the system implements role-based access control to ensure appropriate functionality for different user types. Students have access to planning and tracking features, while advisors have exclusive access to the review and approval interface. This separation ensures data security and appropriate workflow management.

Finally, the platform provides a notification system that keeps students informed about important academic events such as study plan approvals, course recommendations, registration deadlines, and prerequisite completions. This proactive communication helps students stay on track with their academic goals and avoid missing critical deadlines.

TARGET USERS

The system serves two distinct user groups, each with tailored interfaces and functionalities:

Students enrolled in the Computer Information Systems program at the University of Jordan represent the primary user base. These students use the system to track their academic progress, explore available courses, receive AI-powered recommendations, and submit study plans for advisor approval. The system is designed to be intuitive and accessible, requiring minimal training for students to begin using it effectively.

Academic advisors and administrators form the secondary user group. These users access the Advisor Dashboard to review student study plan submissions, approve or reject applications, and provide feedback to students. The system's design prioritizes efficiency for advisors, allowing them to process multiple student requests quickly while maintaining thorough review capabilities.

SYSTEM SCOPE

The AI Academic Advisor system covers the complete Computer Information Systems curriculum at the University of Jordan, which consists of 132 credit hours distributed across four academic years. The system includes all course information, prerequisite relationships, and recommended semester placements. It tracks student progress through University Requirements (27 credits), Faculty Requirements (24 credits), Core Specialization Courses (69 credits), and Elective Courses (12 credits).

The platform handles the entire study plan approval workflow, from initial student submission through advisor review to final approval or rejection. It maintains records of submission dates, approval dates, and rejection reasons, providing a complete audit trail of the academic planning process.

TECHNICAL FOUNDATION

Built using modern web technologies including React and TypeScript, the system provides a responsive, user-friendly interface that works across different devices and screen sizes. The architecture supports future expansion and integration with existing university systems, making it a scalable solution for academic planning needs.

The system currently operates with sample data to demonstrate functionality, but the architecture is designed to integrate with backend databases and authentication systems when deployed in a production environment. This design approach allows for thorough testing and demonstration while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

BENEFITS AND IMPACT

The implementation of the AI Academic Advisor system brings several significant benefits to both students and the university administration:

For students, the system provides greater autonomy in academic planning while ensuring they have access to expert guidance when needed. The visual progress tracking helps students understand their academic standing at a glance, and the AI chatbot offers immediate answers to common questions without requiring advisor availability. The comprehensive course catalog eliminates confusion about prerequisites and course requirements, reducing the likelihood of registration errors.

For advisors, the system dramatically improves efficiency by centralizing all student requests and providing clear, organized information about each submission. The ability to quickly review multiple plans, check prerequisites, and make decisions with appropriate documentation saves significant time compared to traditional email-based or in-person advising processes.

For the university as a whole, the system represents a step toward modernizing academic services and improving student satisfaction. By providing better tools for academic planning, the university can potentially improve student retention, reduce time to graduation, and enhance the overall quality of academic advising services.

CONCLUSION

The AI Academic Advisor system represents a comprehensive solution to the challenges of academic planning and advising in higher education. By combining intelligent course recommendations, efficient workflow management, and user-friendly interfaces, the platform creates a better experience for both students and advisors. As the system continues to evolve and integrate with additional university systems, it has the potential to become an essential tool for academic success at the University of Jordan and serve as a model for similar implementations at other institutions.

The system's design philosophy centers on empowerment—giving students the tools they need to succeed while providing advisors with the efficiency they need to serve more students effectively. This balance between student autonomy and advisor oversight creates a collaborative environment that supports academic achievement and timely degree completion.
